# Todo App

## This is a simple Todo App built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The app allows users to add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The backend provides a REST API, and the frontend interacts with it using Axios. This project is perfect for learning how to connect React with Spring Boot to create a full-stack web application. ðŸš€
